# Stock_prediction_prjt
In the project firtsly after collecting the data and fetching it 
I have chosen ema , sma,macd as my factors(techinal ) to analyse and predict the stock prize
The reason of me chosing them is macd is very easy to use and effective in predicting the stock reversal,
And sma and ema (5 day) are also easy to see and they are effective for short term investors,
And ema is more preferable because it gives more priority to recent days
after that by taking these technical factors i have created a model to train and test them
at last by calculating r2 score (
say if is 0.65(for AAPL its around 0.65) 
it indicates that nearly 65 % changes of stock are accounted by these factors 
i.e the dependent variable nearly depends on independent variable around 65%
so after calculating r2 we can observe the graphs drawn if it is around 0.6-0.7 it would be better to prdict using these techinical factors
